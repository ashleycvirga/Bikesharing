Peak ridership occurs between 7am and 9am weekday mornings, 5pm to 7pm weekday evenings and between 12pm and 5pm on weekends for all users.

Peak ridership trip times seem to follow a similar pattern across all genders.  Male riders dominate in number of rides.

5. Heatmap of Trips by Weekday and By Gender and Usertype

Most rides are taken by subscribers with the male gender riding with the most frequency. Subscribers ride most during the Monday through Friday traditional work week. Citi bikes are a great way to beat commute traffic in NYC!

The majority of users are subscribers which ensures a regular income stream for Citi bike investors. Male riders dominate users of both types.

## Summary
- Male riders and male subscriber riders seem to utilize citi bikes most frequently. This can be explained by the fact that female attire is often less suitable for bike riding than males'--especially workwear.  Perhaps placing a changing room next to the bike pick up and drop off stations would provide a safe place to change in and out of work wear and increase ridership for all genders.
- Peak ridership times suggest work week commuters are the main customer base for Citi Bikes. These times are consistent accross genders and most consistent for subscriber usertypes. 
- Citi Bikes are a great way to enhance the commute experience of their riders and subscription services provide a reliable revenue stream for investors alike.
- Des Moines, Iowas is a major metropolitan area with many area residents commuting into the city for work. Citi Bikes would provide an excellent service for the commuters of Des Moines!
- Weekend city tourists enjoy the bikes as well in NYC.  

### Additional Visual Reccomendations
